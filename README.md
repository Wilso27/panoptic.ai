### Executive Summary

Your task is to create a simple, modern, and visually appealing web-based demo that allows users to input information related to a cybersecurity vulnerability and then displays a generated solution based on the input. This web demo will be used in pitch meetings to showcase the functionality to potential investors.

### Project Roadmap

1. **Set Up the Project Environment**:
   - **Install necessary packages**: Ensure you have Flask installed for the backend.
   - **Create project structure**: Organize your project files into a clear structure with separate folders for templates (HTML files), static files (CSS, images), and the main Python script.
   - **Initialize a virtual environment (optional)**: To manage dependencies cleanly.

2. **Design the Web Page Layout**:
   - **Create the HTML form**: Design a form with five text input fields (Vulnerability, Diagnosis, Consequences, Solution, Vulnerability Location(s)) and a submit button.
   - **Add a response display area**: Below the form, include a section to display the generated response.
   - **Ensure the page is centered and styled**: Use CSS to create a modern, clean look. The layout should be responsive and aesthetically pleasing.

3. **Backend Development**:
   - **Set up Flask routes**: Create routes to render the HTML form and handle form submissions.
   - **Integrate the `generate_solution` function**: When the form is submitted, capture the input data, pass it to the `generate_solution` function, and then display the response.

4. **Frontend Styling**:
   - **Use CSS for styling**: Implement a sleek, modern design using CSS. Ensure the text boxes, buttons, and response area are well-styled and aligned.
   - **Consider using a CSS framework**: If desired, you can use a simple framework like Bootstrap to speed up styling and ensure a responsive design.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - **Test the form submission**: Ensure that data entered into the form is correctly passed to the backend, and the generated response is displayed properly.
   - **Cross-browser testing**: Verify that the site looks and works well on different browsers and screen sizes.

6. **Documentation**:
   - **Update the README**: Include instructions on how to run the Flask app and any dependencies required.
   - **Add comments**: Ensure your code is well-commented to make it easy to understand for others.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - **Deploy the web app**: If needed, deploy the Flask app to a hosting service (e.g., Heroku) for easy access during investor pitches.

### Summary
This roadmap outlines the key steps to build a simple, functional, and visually appealing web demo using Flask for backend and basic HTML/CSS for the frontend. Your goal is to create a streamlined and polished user experience to effectively showcase the functionality to potential investors.
